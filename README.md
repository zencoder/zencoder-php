To help address problems where users cannot modify php.ini to point cURL to their system CA bundle path, or are using a PHP release before 5.3.7, we have extended this library to allow users to set CURLOPT\_CAPATH and CURLOPT\_CAINFO on the cURL connection used to submit requests.

```php
$zencoder = new Services_Zencoder($my_api_key, 'v2', 'https://app.zencoder.com', false, $my_curlopt_capath, $my_curlopt_cainfo);
```

See also the constructor for `Services_Zencoder` for more information on the available arguments.

See [the cURL CA bundle extraction page](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) for information on obtaining a CA bundle. We recommend using the HTTPS link to download the CA bundle.

Version: 2.2.0

Repository: <http://github.com/zencoder/zencoder-php/>

The Zencoder CA chain certificate has been removed from the library as the bundled cert will be expiring on July 26 2014,
and should not be required as PHP/curl should be able to use the built in CA chain.

Version: 2.1.1

Date:    2012-08-02

Repository: <http://github.com/zencoder/zencoder-php/>

Parts of this library are based on <http://github.com/twilio/twilio-php>

For more details on v2 of the Zencoder API visit
<http://blog.zencoder.com/2012/01/05/announcing-zencoder-api-v2/>

For more details on the Zencoder API requirements visit
<https://support.brightcove.com/zencoder>

To start working with the library, create a new instance of the Services_Zencoder class, passing
your API Key as the 1st parameter.

```php
$zencoder = new Services_Zencoder('93h630j1dsyshjef620qlkavnmzui3');
```

Once you have created the object, you can use it to interact with the API. For full information,
see the Documentation folder, but here is a quick overview of some of the functions that can be
called:

```php
$zencoder->accounts->create($array);
$zencoder->jobs->create($array);
$zencoder->jobs->progress($job_id);
$zencoder->inputs->details($input_id);
$zencoder->outputs->details($output_id);
$zencoder->notifications->parseIncoming();
$zencoder->reports->details($report_type, $optional_params);
```

Any errors will throw a Services_Zencoder_Exception. You can call getErrors() on an exception
and it will return any errors received from the Zencoder API.


ENCODING JOB
------------

The ZencoderJob object creates an encoding job using cURL
to send JSON formatted parameters to Zencoder's encoding API.

### Step 1

Visit the [API builder](https://app.zencoder.com/api_builder) in your account,
and execute a successful encoding job.

### Step 2

Copy the successful JSON string, starting with the first curly brace "{",
and pass it as the parameters for a new ZencoderJob object. Execute the script on your server to test that it works.

#### Example

```php
<?php

// Make sure this points to a copy of Zencoder.php on the same server as this script.
require_once('Services/Zencoder.php');

try {
  // Initialize the Services_Zencoder class
  $zencoder = new Services_Zencoder('93h630j1dsyshjef620qlkavnmzui3');

  // New Encoding Job
  $encoding_job = $zencoder->jobs->create(
    array(
      "input" => "s3://bucket-name/file-name.avi",
      "outputs" => array(
        array(
          "label" => "web"
        )
      )
    )
  );

  // Success if we got here
  echo "w00t! \n\n";
  echo "Job ID: ".$encoding_job->id."\n";
  echo "Output ID: ".$encoding_job->outputs['web']->id."\n";
  // Store Job/Output IDs to update their status when notified or to check their progress.
} catch (Services_Zencoder_Exception $e) {
  // If were here, an error occurred
  echo "Fail :(\n\n";
  echo "Errors:\n";
  foreach ($e->getErrors() as $error) echo $error."\n";
  echo "Full exception dump:\n\n";
  print_r($e);
}

echo "\nAll Job Attributes:\n";
var_dump($encoding_job);

?>
```

### Step 3

Modify the above script to meet your needs.  

Your [API Request History](https://app.zencoder.com/api_requests) may come in handy.  

You can revisit your [API builder](https://app.zencoder.com/api_builder) to add/update parameters of the JSON.  

You can translate the JSON string into nested associative arrays so that you can dynamically change attributes like "input".  
The previous JSON example would become:

```php
$encoding_job = $zencoder->jobs->create(array(
  "input" => "s3://bucket-name/file-name.avi",
  "outputs" => array(
    array(
      "label" => "web"
    )
  )
));
```

NOTIFICATION HANDLING
----------------------

The ZencoderOutputNotification class is used to capture and parse JSON data sent from
Zencoder to your app when an output file has been completed.



### Step 1

Create a script to receive notifications, and upload it to a location on your server that is publicly accessible.

#### Example

```php
<?php

// Make sure this points to a copy of Zencoder.php on the same server as this script.
require_once('Services/Zencoder.php');

// Initialize the Services_Zencoder class
$zencoder = new Services_Zencoder('93h630j1dsyshjef620qlkavnmzui3');

// Catch notification
$notification = $zencoder->notifications->parseIncoming();

// Check output/job state
if($notification->job->outputs[0]->state == "finished") {
  echo "w00t!\n";

  // If you're encoding to multiple outputs and only care when all of the outputs are finished
  // you can check if the entire job is finished.
  if($notification->job->state == "finished") {
    echo "Dubble w00t!";
  }
} elseif ($notification->job->outputs[0]->state == "cancelled") {
  echo "Cancelled!\n";
} else {
  echo "Fail!\n";
  echo $notification->job->outputs[0]->error_message."\n";
  echo $notification->job->outputs[0]->error_link;
}

?>
```

### Step 2

In the parameters for an encoding job, add the URL for your script to the notifications array of each output you want to be notified for. 
Then submit the job to test if it works.  

**You can view the results at:**  
<https://app.zencoder.com/notifications>

#### Example

```php
...
"outputs" => array(
  array(
    "label" => "web",
    "notifications" => array("http://example.com.com/encoding/notification.php")
  ),
  array(
    "label" => "iPhone",
    "notifications" => array("http://example.com.com/encoding/notification.php")
  )
)
...
```

### Step 3

Modify the above script to meet your needs.  

Your [notifications page](https://app.zencoder.com/notifications) will come in handy.

REPORTS
----------------------
The ZencoderReports class is used to get reports over the zencoder api.
See [reports api doc](https://app.zencoder.com/docs/api/reports) for required/optional parameters.

### Get usage for ALL reports
Create a script to get reports for a specified date range

#### Example
```php

    // Make sure this points to a copy of Zencoder.php on the same server as this script.
    require_once('Services/Zencoder.php');

    // Initialize the Services_Zencoder class
    $zencoder = new Services_Zencoder('93h630j1dsyshjef620qlkavnmzui3');

    // Get reports
    $params = array(
        'from' => '2014-02-01',
        'to' => '2014-02-28',
    )

    // 'all' can be replaced by 'vod' or 'live' acccording to entry points in docs
    $report = $zencoder->reports->details('all', $params);

    // Each reports object should have a 'statistics' and 'total' base element
    if ($report->statistics) {
        foreach ($report->statistics as $statistic) {
            print_r($statistic);
        }
        print_r($report->total);
    } else {
        echo "no statistics found";
    }

```
